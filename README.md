# Welcome to the Push-up Counter!

The Push-up Counter uses a computer vision model, built with OpenCV and Mediapipe, to detect push-ups performed correctly via webcam. This project was developed using Python, Flask, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. You can try for yourself at [pushupcounter.xyz](http://pushupcounter.xyz) or watch a [demo](https://youtu.be/KBQlJlMYalo) of the model in action!
